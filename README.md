# Resume
Hello folks,
here you can explore my personal resume describing my IT knowledge and 
my career in computer science in general. You can use the code stored in this repo 
as a inspiration for your own resume or just check out how I did it? 
Main motivation to create this pages, beside to create representation of my person, it was to try use as many as possible skills in web development.

#### Up and running version of those pages are available here in [msurynek.com](http://msurynek.com).
